🔵 **OVERVIEW**
A statistical trend analysis tool that combines moving average dynamics with standard deviation zones and trend-specific price distribution.
This is an *experimental indicator* designed for educational and learning purposes only.

🔵 **CONCEPTS**

- **Trend Detection via SMA Slope:** Detects trend shifts when the slope of the SMA exceeds a ±0.1 threshold.
- **Standard Deviation Zones:** Calculates ±1, ±2, and ±3 levels from the SMA using ATR, forming dynamic envelopes around the mean.
- **Trend Distribution Profile:** Builds a histogram that shows how often price closed within each deviation zone during the active trend phase.

🔵 **FEATURES**

- **Trend Signals:** Immediate shift markers using colored circles at trend reversals.
- **SMA Gradient Coloring:** The SMA line dynamically changes color based on its directional slope.

🔵 **HOW TO USE**

- Use trend shift dots as entry signals:
    • 🔵 = Bullish start
    • 🔴 = Bearish start
- Trade with the trend when price clusters in outer zones (±2 or ±3).
- Be cautious or fade the trend when price distribution contracts toward the SMA.
