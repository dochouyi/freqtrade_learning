VFI,introduced by Markos Katsanos, is based on the popular On Balance Volume (OBV) but with three very important modifications:

\* Unlike the OBV, indicator values are no longer meaningless. Positive readings are bullish and negative bearish.
\* The calculation is based on the day's median (typical price) instead of the closing price.
\* A volatility threshold takes into account minimal price changes and another threshold eliminates excessive volume.

A simplified interpretation of the VFI is:
\* Values above zero indicate a bullish state and the crossing of the zero line is the trigger or buy signal.
\* The strongest signal with all money flow indicators is of course divergence.

I have exposed options to plot a signal EMA. All parameters are configurable.

Markos suggests using 0.2 coeff for day trading and 0.1 for intra-day.
