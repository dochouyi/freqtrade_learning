Designed with the help of TTrades and with inspiration from the ICT Everything indicator by coldbrewrosh, the purpose of this script is to identify ICT Killzones while also storing their highs and lows for future reference, until traded through.

There are 5 Killzones / sessions whose times and labels can all be changed to one's liking. Some prefer slight alterations to traditional ICT Killzones, or use different time windows altogether. Either way, the sessions are fully customizable. The sessions will auto fit to keep track of the highs and lows made during their respective times, and these pivots will be extended until they are invalidated.

There are also 4 optional Open Price lines and 4 vertical Timestamps, where the user can change the time and style of each one as well.

To help maintain a clean chart, we can implement a Cutoff Time where all drawings will stop extending past a certain point. The indicator will apply this logic by default, as it can get messy with multiple drawings starting and stopping throughout the day at different times.

Given the amount of interest I've received about this indicator, I intend to leave it open to suggestions for further improvements. Let me know what you think & what you want to see added!
