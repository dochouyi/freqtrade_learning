**Helo All,**

I got many requests for a Breakout script and here it's. This script searches the breakouts/breakdowns and draw square if there is one.

**The options:**
*"Period"* is used to find Pivot Points
**"Max Breakout Length"\* is the maximum length to search breakouts
"Threshold Rate %"* is channel width of the breakout area. calculated using highest/lowest of last 300 bars.
*"Minimum Number of Tests"* is the minimum number of tests that the Price tried to break the S/R level
and some options for coloring and linestyle

Lets see some examples:

in this example *"Minimum Number of Tests"* is 2 so the Price must have tested to break resistance area 2 times and then it breaks it as seen in the screenshot:

in following example *Threshold rate* is %10, so the channel width is very big:
