Here is a combination of the classic MACD (moving average convergence divergence indicator) with the classic slow moving average SMA with period 200 together as a strategy.

This strategy goes long if the MACD histogram and the MACD momentum are both above zero and the fast MACD moving average is above the slow MACD moving average. As additional long filter the recent price has to be above the SMA 200. If the inverse logic is true, the strategy goes short. For the worst case there is a max intraday equity loss of 50% filter.

**All trading involves high risk; past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain inherent limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not actually been executed, the results may have under- or over-compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown.**
